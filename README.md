> This version is Deprecated

*****

## Entire python recode :
* I've decided to **change the language**, because the bash one started to be a little too messy...
* I've choosen python cause it's nice, **simple**, efficient but more :
    * There is a lot of tool made by the community (like **eyed3**) that can be imported very easily
    * It allow an **easier installation**
    * It will be fully **compatible** with Linux/Os x/Windows without hacking (like previously for os x)
* The actual version is stil a **Work in Progress** but it fixes already a lot of bug that are on the bash one.
* Follow the progress **[here](https://github.com/flyingrub/scdl/issues/2)**

## Python Version
I have choosen to make a brand **new git**, be sure to follow it **[here](https://github.com/flyingrub/scdl)**
